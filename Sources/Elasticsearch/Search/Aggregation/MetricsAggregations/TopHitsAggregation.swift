/**
 A top_hits metric aggregator keeps track of the most relevant document being
 aggregated. This aggregator is intended to be used as a sub aggregator, so that
 the top matching documents can be aggregated per bucket.

 The top_hits aggregator can effectively be used to group result sets by certain
 fields via a bucket aggregator. One or more bucket aggregators determines by
 which properties a result set get sliced into.
